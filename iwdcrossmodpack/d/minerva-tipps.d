== L#TipB ~You remembered my family name? Now that's a surprise! Even more so given you didn't make a single mistake pronouncing it.~
== BC0MMin ~Haha, you think 'Rattletattle' is hard to say? I grew up learning words like 'anthropology', 'empiricism' and 'anesthesiology'. I dare you to say any of those three times fast!~

== BC0MMin ~Sure. It's nice and tropical in the islands. No need to wrap up in warm blankets at night for fear of freezing to death.~
