== L#OMB ~Ugh.~
== L#DUSKYB ~What I was going to say was that it wouldn't be easy for a big man like you to hide. Not that you'd need to, with how strong you are.~
== L#OMB ~Hmh. Don't understimate my skillsâ€”I may not be the most nimble person, but I'm still a born hunter.~
== L#DUSKYB ~I never said you weren't. But hiding in forests and in a dungeon are two different things. I'm just not sure being subtle will work with you around.~
== L#OMB ~I'm not going to get in the way, you can count on that much..~
