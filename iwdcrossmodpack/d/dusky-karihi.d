== L#DUSKYB ~And I'm sure the well-to-do province from which you were born compares to it like night and day. So what brings you here?~
== BC0KARIH ~What indeed. Certainly not to be interrogated by a vagabond out here in the freezing wind.~
== L#DUSKYB ~Could it be that you're trying to run away from something, eh?~

== L#DUSKYB ~Fine. Although... you never did put my concerns to rest, by the way. Should I expect a fireball in my direction in our next battle?~
