== L#DUSKYB ~I was just thinking you could use your magic to have some fun. Like causing some chaos in Kuldahar... imagine causing the grass to grow and tickle everyone, or something silly like that.~
== L#TIPB ~You want me to pull some prank on simple villagers? Do I look like a brat to you? No, don't answer that. You'll probably say yes just to rile me up.~
== L#DUSKYB ~No, I really thought it'd be fun. I feel everyone's too serious nowadays, and they need some pranks to lighten them up. There aren't enough laughs being shared around.~

== L#DUSKYB ~Good idea, eh?~
